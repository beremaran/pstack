description: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a Markdown file in the repo. Use when the user wants a topic researched, docs or API facts gathered, or reading legwork delegated to a background agent.

Read the [portable runtime contract](../pstack-runtime/SKILL.md) before executing this workflow. Skill names here identify files to read and follow; they do not require a host-specific skill tool. Use [the shared Matt Pocock prerequisites and host fallbacks](../mattpocock-ask-matt/PORTABILITY.md) for delegation, integrations, context changes, and authorization.

Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** (official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs), not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it where the repo already keeps such notes; match the existing convention, and if there is none, put it somewhere sensible and say where.
